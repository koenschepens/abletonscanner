## Example

The example below will find the element with an id of *my_video* and render a video player into it. 

```js
    // Create a jwplayer instance
    jwplayer('my_video').setup({
        file: '/uploads/example.mp4',
    });

    // Add a custom callback for when user pauses playback
    jwplayer('my_video').on('pause', function(event) {
        alert('Why did my user pause their video instead of watching it?');
    });
```

Other callbacks that we provide include
* **play / complete**
* **seek / pause**
* **volume / mute**
* **[and more](http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/topics/564475-javascript-api/articles)**

You also have the power to programatically set any configuration within the player. 

```js
    function bumpIt() {
    	var vol = player.getVolume();
        player.setVolume(vol + 10 );
    }
```
